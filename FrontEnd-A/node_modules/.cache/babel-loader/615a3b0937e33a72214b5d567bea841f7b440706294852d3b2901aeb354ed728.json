Experience bullets  \n     2. Summary section  \n     3. Technical Skills section  \n   - Ensure these keywords appear in multiple resume sections for ATS reinforcement.\n3. **ATS-Friendly Structure**\n   - Use standard section headers: \"Professional Summary\", \"Technical Skills\", \"Professional Experience\", \"Education\".\n   - Format dates as \"Month YYYY\".\n   - Include graduation dates in Education.\n4. **Bullet Point Format**\n  - Use Google's XYZ formula: \"Accomplished [X] by doing [Y] using [Z]\".\n   - Keep bullets as concise as possible, Make sure the bullet points fills the complete two lines. Each bullet point Should have maximum of 30 words, It should not just end up in the middle or starting of the second line, ideally 2-3 lines long (absolute maximum of 3 lines).\n   - When creating bullet points, structure sentences to ensure line breaks are aesthetically pleasing. Avoid having a single word wrap to a new line.\n   - Rephrase bullets if necessary to achieve a more balanced line ending.\n   - Vary action verbs (Led, Engineered, Implemented, Optimized, Automated, Orchestrated, Designed, Delivered, Streamlined). Make sure all the bullet points that you give do not repeat any of these action verbs.\n   - Quantify results with metrics in **bold** using LaTeX (e.g., \\\\\\\\textbf{20\\\\%}).\n   \n5. **Summary**\n   - Tailor to emphasize JD-required skills and responsibilities.\n   - Mention role title from JD (e.g., ‚ÄúFront End Web Developer‚Äù) if applicable.\n  - Keep bullets as concise as possible, Make sure the bullet points fills the complete two lines , It should not just end up in the middle or starting of the second line, ideally 2-3 lines long (absolute maximum of 3 lines).\n-Each bullet point should have a maximum of 30 words.\n\n6. **Experience Sections (MetLife & Adons Soft Tech)**:\n   - **JD Mapping Priority**: For each role, extract the top 5 most critical technical skills and responsibilities from the job description. These MUST appear in the first 3-4 bullets for that role.\n   - **Technology Integration**: If the JD mentions specific frameworks, tools, or methodologies not currently in your experience, weave them into relevant bullets by connecting them to similar work you've done.\n   - **Relevance Scoring**: Each bullet point must score 7/10 or higher for JD relevance. If it's below 7/10, either rewrite it to be more relevant or remove it entirely.\n   - **Two-Line Optimization**: Structure each bullet to fill exactly 2 full lines. Target 25-30 words per bullet, ensuring the second line has at least 8-10 words (never just 1-3 words hanging).\n   - **Context Bridging**: When adapting your actual experience to match JD requirements, use phrases like \"leveraged [your actual tech] to achieve [JD outcome]\" or \"implemented [JD methodology] using [your tools].\"\n   - **Quantifiable Impact**: Every bullet should include a metric that relates to business value mentioned in the JD (performance, user experience, efficiency, scalability).\n   - Limit to 5-6 bullets per role, prioritizing JD alignment over comprehensive experience listing.\n\n7. **Balanced Role Representation**\n   - Maintain accuracy of your background but shift emphasis toward skills relevant to the target JD.\n   - Keep backend and other skills for completeness, but do not let them overshadow JD-priority skills.\n\n8. **Technical Skills**\n   - **JD-First Ordering**: List skills in this exact priority:\n     1. Technologies explicitly mentioned in JD requirements\n     2. Technologies mentioned in JD preferred qualifications  \n     3. Related/complementary technologies from your background\n     4. Additional relevant skills (only if space permits)\n   - **Category Restructuring**: Instead of generic categories (Frontend, Backend), use JD-aligned categories like \"Core Technologies,\" \"Development Tools,\" \"Frameworks & Libraries,\" etc.\n   - **Space Management**: If skills overflow the page, ruthlessly cut anything not mentioned in or directly supportive of the JD requirements.\n   - Use LaTeX tabular format with proper line breaking (\\\\) to prevent overflow.\n\n9. **LaTeX Line-Wrapping Optimization**\n   - Given the tight margins of the provided resume template, the total line length for bullet points is limited.\n   - **Crucially, avoid sentences that exceed approximately 15-20 words per line.** Rephrase longer sentences to be more concise.\n   - **Two-Line Target**: Each bullet point should utilize exactly 2 lines of text. If a bullet is only 1.2 lines, add relevant detail. If it's 2.8 lines, trim excess words.\n   - **Second Line Minimum**: The second line must contain at least 8-10 words to create visual balance and maximize content utilization.\n   - **NEVER allow a sentence to end with only one or two words on the second line.** If this occurs, rewrite the sentence to shift at least three or four words onto that final line, ensuring a balanced visual appearance.\n   - **Example of poor wrapping:**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  ...improving processing speed by\n  **45%**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- **Example of good wrapping:**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  ...improving processing speed and\n  reducing latency by **45%**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n   \n   - Achieve this by a) shortening the sentence, or b) rephrasing it to distribute words more evenly.\n  10. **JD Keyword Integration Strategy**\n   - **Semantic Matching**: Don't just stuff keywords. Use them in context that demonstrates actual application.\n   - **Skill Translation**: Map your actual experience to JD language (e.g., if JD says \"responsive design\" and you have \"mobile optimization,\" use \"responsive design\" in your bullets).\n   - **Missing Skill Handling**: If JD requires a technology you haven't used professionally, integrate it as \"gained exposure to [technology] through [relevant project/learning context].\"\n\n\n===========================\nüíº UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS:\n===========================\n\n2. **Professional Summary**:\n   - Keep the first bullet from the original resume.\n   - Replace remaining bullets with concise, keyword-rich statements matching the JD and covering missing functional points (collaboration, documentation, testing).\n-Each bullet point should have a maximum of 30 words.\n3. Rewrite **MetLife** and **Adons Soft Tech** experiences to surface JD-relevant duties and technologies first.\n4. Ensure JD-critical keywords appear in **Experience, Summary, and Skills**.\n5. Keep Nagarro and Internships unchanged unless they contain JD-relevant experiences.\n6. Provide a concise \"changes\" summary.\n7. Rewrite cover letter & cold email to align with the JD.\n8. Output final LaTeX resume with double escapes (\\\\\\\\) and escaped apostrophes (\\\\\\\\textquotesingle{}).\n9. **Action Verb Variety Rule**\n   - Track usage of action verbs in all bullet points.\n   - Do not use the same verb more than twice across the entire resume.\n   - If a verb like \"Developed\" is used more than twice, replace the rest with synonyms appropriate for the context:\n     - Developed ‚Üí Built, Engineered, Created, Designed, Produced, Constructed, Delivered, Formulated, Launched, Innovated.\n   - Ensure the first word of each bullet is a strong action verb and avoid starting consecutive bullets with the same verb.\n\n===========================\nüìù OUTPUT FORMAT:\n===========================\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON in this EXACT format:\n\n\\`\\`\\`json\n{\n  \"companyName\": \"Company Name\",\n  \"summaryLatex\": \"ONLY the \\\\\\\\item content for Professional Summary - do NOT include \\\\\\\\begin{itemize} or \\\\\\\\end{itemize}.

Experience bullets  \n     2. Summary section  \n     3. Technical Skills section  \n   - Ensure these keywords appear in multiple resume sections for ATS reinforcement.\n3. **ATS-Friendly Structure**\n   - Use standard section headers: \"Professional Summary\", \"Technical Skills\", \"Professional Experience\", \"Education\".\n   - Format dates as \"Month YYYY\".\n   - Include graduation dates in Education.\n4. **Bullet Point Format**\n  - Use Google's XYZ formula: \"Accomplished [X] by doing [Y] using [Z]\".\n   - Keep bullets as concise as possible, Make sure the bullet points fills the complete two lines. Each bullet point Should have maximum of 30 words, It should not just end up in the middle or starting of the second line, ideally 2-3 lines long (absolute maximum of 3 lines).\n   - When creating bullet points, structure sentences to ensure line breaks are aesthetically pleasing. Avoid having a single word wrap to a new line.\n   - Rephrase bullets if necessary to achieve a more balanced line ending.\n   - Vary action verbs (Led, Engineered, Implemented, Optimized, Automated, Orchestrated, Designed, Delivered, Streamlined). Make sure all the bullet points that you give do not repeat any of these action verbs.\n   - Quantify results with metrics in **bold** using LaTeX (e.g., \\\\\\\\textbf{20\\\\%}).\n   \n5. **Summary**\n   - Tailor to emphasize JD-required skills and responsibilities.\n   - Mention role title from JD (e.g., ‚ÄúFront End Web Developer‚Äù) if applicable.\n  - Keep bullets as concise as possible, Make sure the bullet points fills the complete two lines , It should not just end up in the middle or starting of the second line, ideally 2-3 lines long (absolute maximum of 3 lines).\n-Each bullet point should have a maximum of 30 words.\n\n6. **Experience Sections (MetLife & Adons Soft Tech)**:\n   - **JD Mapping Priority**: For each role, extract the top 5 most critical technical skills and responsibilities from the job description. These MUST appear in the first 3-4 bullets for that role.\n   - **Technology Integration**: If the JD mentions specific frameworks, tools, or methodologies not currently in your experience, weave them into relevant bullets by connecting them to similar work you've done.\n   - **Relevance Scoring**: Each bullet point must score 7/10 or higher for JD relevance. If it's below 7/10, either rewrite it to be more relevant or remove it entirely.\n   - **Two-Line Optimization**: Structure each bullet to fill exactly 2 full lines. Target 25-30 words per bullet, ensuring the second line has at least 8-10 words (never just 1-3 words hanging).\n   - **Context Bridging**: When adapting your actual experience to match JD requirements, use phrases like \"leveraged [your actual tech] to achieve [JD outcome]\" or \"implemented [JD methodology] using [your tools].\"\n   - **Quantifiable Impact**: Every bullet should include a metric that relates to business value mentioned in the JD (performance, user experience, efficiency, scalability).\n   - Limit to 5-6 bullets per role, prioritizing JD alignment over comprehensive experience listing.\n\n7. **Balanced Role Representation**\n   - Maintain accuracy of your background but shift emphasis toward skills relevant to the target JD.\n   - Keep backend and other skills for completeness, but do not let them overshadow JD-priority skills.\n\n8. **Technical Skills**\n   - **JD-First Ordering**: List skills in this exact priority:\n     1. Technologies explicitly mentioned in JD requirements\n     2. Technologies mentioned in JD preferred qualifications  \n     3. Related/complementary technologies from your background\n     4. Additional relevant skills (only if space permits)\n   - **Category Restructuring**: Instead of generic categories (Frontend, Backend), use JD-aligned categories like \"Core Technologies,\" \"Development Tools,\" \"Frameworks & Libraries,\" etc.\n   - **Space Management**: If skills overflow the page, ruthlessly cut anything not mentioned in or directly supportive of the JD requirements.\n   - Use LaTeX tabular format with proper line breaking (\\\\) to prevent overflow.\n\n9. **LaTeX Line-Wrapping Optimization**\n   - Given the tight margins of the provided resume template, the total line length for bullet points is limited.\n   - **Crucially, avoid sentences that exceed approximately 15-20 words per line.** Rephrase longer sentences to be more concise.\n   - **Two-Line Target**: Each bullet point should utilize exactly 2 lines of text. If a bullet is only 1.2 lines, add relevant detail. If it's 2.8 lines, trim excess words.\n   - **Second Line Minimum**: The second line must contain at least 8-10 words to create visual balance and maximize content utilization.\n   - **NEVER allow a sentence to end with only one or two words on the second line.** If this occurs, rewrite the sentence to shift at least three or four words onto that final line, ensuring a balanced visual appearance.\n   - **Example of poor wrapping:**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  ...improving processing speed by\n  **45%**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- **Example of good wrapping:**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  ...improving processing speed and\n  reducing latency by **45%**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n   \n   - Achieve this by a) shortening the sentence, or b) rephrasing it to distribute words more evenly.\n  10. **JD Keyword Integration Strategy**\n   - **Semantic Matching**: Don't just stuff keywords. Use them in context that demonstrates actual application.\n   - **Skill Translation**: Map your actual experience to JD language (e.g., if JD says \"responsive design\" and you have \"mobile optimization,\" use \"responsive design\" in your bullets).\n   - **Missing Skill Handling**: If JD requires a technology you haven't used professionally, integrate it as \"gained exposure to [technology] through [relevant project/learning context].\"\n\n\n===========================\nüíº UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS:\n===========================\n\n2. **Professional Summary**:\n   - Keep the first bullet from the original resume.\n   - Replace remaining bullets with concise, keyword-rich statements matching the JD and covering missing functional points (collaboration, documentation, testing).\n-Each bullet point should have a maximum of 30 words.\n3. Rewrite **MetLife** and **Adons Soft Tech** experiences to surface JD-relevant duties and technologies first.\n4. Ensure JD-critical keywords appear in **Experience, Summary, and Skills**.\n5. Keep Nagarro and Internships unchanged unless they contain JD-relevant experiences.\n6. Provide a concise \"changes\" summary.\n7. Rewrite cover letter & cold email to align with the JD.\n8. Output final LaTeX resume with double escapes (\\\\\\\\) and escaped apostrophes (\\\\\\\\textquotesingle{}).\n9. **Action Verb Variety Rule**\n   - Track usage of action verbs in all bullet points.\n   - Do not use the same verb more than twice across the entire resume.\n   - If a verb like \"Developed\" is used more than twice, replace the rest with synonyms appropriate for the context:\n     - Developed ‚Üí Built, Engineered, Created, Designed, Produced, Constructed, Delivered, Formulated, Launched, Innovated.\n   - Ensure the first word of each bullet is a strong action verb and avoid starting consecutive bullets with the same verb.\n\n===========================\nüìù OUTPUT FORMAT:\n===========================\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON in this EXACT format:\n\n\\`\\`\\`json\n{\n  \"companyName\": \"Company Name\",\n  \"summaryLatex\": \"ONLY the \\\\\\\\item content for Professional Summary - do NOT include \\\\\\\\begin{itemize} or \\\\\\\\end{itemize}.
