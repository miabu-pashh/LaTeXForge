Each bullet point Should have maximum of 30 words, It should not just end up in the middle or starting of the second line, ideally 2-3 lines long (absolute maximum of 3 lines).\n   - When creating bullet points, structure sentences to ensure line breaks are aesthetically pleasing. Avoid having a single word wrap to a new line.\n   - Rephrase bullets if necessary to achieve a more balanced line ending.\n   - Vary action verbs (Led, Engineered, Implemented, Optimized, Automated, Orchestrated, Designed, Delivered, Streamlined).

If a point is not highly relevant, it should be removed.**\n   - **Pay close attention to line breaks. Rephrase bullet points to avoid leaving just one or two words on a new line, creating a cleaner visual flow.**\n\n   - **Provide a total of 5-6 concise bullet points for each role to save space, but make sure to fulfill the 'at least 4' rule only if it doesn't cause overflow.**\n-Each bullet point should have a maximum of 30 words.\n\n   7. **Balanced Role Representation**\n   - Maintain accuracy of your background but shift emphasis toward skills relevant to the target JD.\n   - Keep backend and other skills for completeness, but do not let them overshadow JD-priority skills.\n\n8. **Technical Skills**\n   - Always group skills into clear categories in a LaTeX tabular format with proper wrapping to avoid overflow.\n   - **If the list of skills is causing the resume to exceed one page, prioritize only the skills that are directly mentioned or highly relevant to the job description.**\n   - Break long category lines using LaTeX line breaks (\\\\\\\\) where needed.\n\n9. **LaTeX Line-Wrapping Optimization**\n   - Given the tight margins of the provided resume template, the total line length for bullet points is limited.\n   - **Crucially, avoid sentences that exceed approximately 15-20 words per line.** Rephrase longer sentences to be more concise.\n   - **NEVER allow a sentence to end with only one or two words on the second line.** If this occurs, rewrite the sentence to shift at least three or four words onto that final line, ensuring a balanced visual appearance.\n   - **Example of poor wrapping:**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  ...improving processing speed by\n  **45%**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n- **Example of good wrapping:**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  ...improving processing speed and\n  reducing latency by **45%**\n  \\`\\`\\`\n   \n   - Achieve this by a) shortening the sentence, or b) rephrasing it to distribute words more evenly.\n\n\n===========================\n💼 UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS:\n===========================\n\n2. **Professional Summary**:\n   - Keep the first bullet from the original resume.\n   - Replace remaining bullets with concise, keyword-rich statements matching the JD and covering missing functional points (collaboration, documentation, testing).\n-Each bullet point should have a maximum of 30 words.\n3.
